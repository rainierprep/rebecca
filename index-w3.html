                    <p>Michael Jordan stars in Space Jam with the Looney Tunes Characters. After announcing his retirement in 1993, Jordan decides to become a baseball player.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, MJ wasn't great at baseball and it becomes evident pretty quickly that he should've stuck to basketball. Meanwhile, on another planet, an amusement park owner is looking to boost ticket sales and sends one of his minions to capture the Looney Tunes to use them for entertainment.</p>
                    <p>To escape, the Looney Tunes challenge the kidnappers to a basketball game. If they win, they go free. If they lose, they become an Amusement Park attraction.</p>
                    <h3>Little did the Monstars know, the Looney Tunes have the Greatest Of All Time on their team.</h3>
